BasketBallApp

AI-Powered Automated Video Analysis for Basketball Games

BasketBallApp is an advanced Python application that integrates the Twelve Labs SDK to deliver AI-driven, end-to-end video understanding for basketball game footage. It automates ingestion, indexing, and semantic analysis of .mp4 videos to extract rich, context-aware insights into gameplay, player performance, and strategic flow.

Core Capabilities
	•	Dynamic Video Selection – Interactive CLI interface to pick target footage from a dataset directory.
	•	Automated Video Indexing – On-the-fly index creation with unique timestamped identifiers for organized processing.
	•	Deep Video Understanding – Leverages Twelve Labs’ pegasus1 engine with both visual and conversation modes enabled for multi-modal comprehension.
	•	Basketball-Specific Analytics – Tracks players and ball movement, evaluates shots (made/missed), passes, defense plays, and crowd/broadcast reactions.
	•	Real-Time Status Updates – Terminal-based progress feedback during upload and analysis.
	•	Insight Generation – Natural-language summaries outlining game flow, key moments, and inferred strategies.

Technical Stack
	•	Language: Python 3.7+
	•	Video AI Framework: Twelve Labs SDK
	•	Data Processing: Automated video indexing, task polling, and NLP-based game analysis
	•	Interface: Command-line driven with live processing feedback
	•	Dependencies: twelvelabs Python package

Engineering Highlights
	1.	Modular Design: Functions separated for selection, indexing, upload, and retrieval for maintainability.
	2.	Error Resilience: Built-in retry logic for delayed AI readiness, with graceful fallback handling.
	3.	Scalable Pipeline: Index naming scheme supports parallel, time-stamped processing without collision.
	4.	Multi-Modal Analysis: Combines visual object tracking with conversational AI to interpret both player actions and commentary context.

Usage Flow
	1.	Place .mp4 basketball game footage inside dataset/.
	2.	Run:python BasketBallApp.py
    3.	Select your video interactively.
	4.	Monitor upload, indexing, and AI analysis in real time.
	5.	Review a comprehensive natural-language breakdown of the game.
